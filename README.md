## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of deep learning projects, which I have developed to explore different aspects of machine learning and artificial intelligence. From image classification to more complex model architectures, these projects highlight my journey in the deep learning space.

## Projects

1. **Image Classification (Cats vs Dogs)**  
   A convolutional neural network (CNN) model that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs using Keras.


(More projects will be added as the repository evolves!)

## Installation

To get started with any of these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-projects.git
2. Navigate to the desired project directory:
   ```bash
   cd deep-learning-projects/project-name
